  <!--<p>Get ready for the wildest, most outrageous sport - Ball Betch! With a uniquely shaped foam ball, folding tripod chairs, and a whole lot of craziness, this game defies logic and embraces chaos. Avoid becoming the Ball Betch by throwing and catching properly, as judged by all players. If you fail, you become the Ball Betch and start a new round, deciding who to throw the ball to while everyone else returns it. Fail again, and you become Double or Triple Ball Betch, earning a point. Reach three points and knock someone out, until only one person remains. Even the losers get to vote on the next plays. Get your friends and get ready for a wild ride of laughter, cursing, and democracy. Welcome to Ball Betch!</p>
